End user goal: _______________________________ End business goal: _____________________________ Acceptance criteria: * product defines any initial functionality requirements they can think of * this is a loose outline that will be finalized through wireframes, flows and discussions * acceptance criteria must be finalized before dev starts 

Example User Story:
As a purchaser on the website I want the ability to pay with a credit card, so that I may immediately confirm my purchase. End user goal: Purchase items with a credit card End business goal: Increase purchases Acceptance criteria: * Accept Discover, Visa, MC * Validate credit card number * Validate expiration data and CVV * Validate billing address * Generate success/failure messages after processing 





- The motivation for this project was to create a website where users can access a variety of tools to aid in feeling good and support their wellness. 
- On this website a user can access sounds, videos, reading articles, see randomly generated positive messages, partake in an informational quiz and post a positive message to the positivity board. The idea was to create a space users could visit to access a variety of tools all on one webpage, ie. music, videos, reading articles, etc. rather than websites which only provide one tool, ie. music. This is what sets this 
- The target audience for this website is anyone interested in promoting wellness, positivity and happiness in their life. 
- To create this website HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Fonts, APIS were utilized. Spotify and API's were specifically used. 
- A number of challenges were faced while making this project. Managing the GitHub repository while following best practices was one of the initial issues faced and continued throughout the project. Creating branches, merging branches and completing pull requests caused some errors. 
- Challeneges were faced when implementing JavaScript in order to obtain user interactivity. Implementing functions was at times difficult and a group effort.  
- Challenges were also faced when implementing media queries to accomodate various screen sizes, especially smaller screens, ie. tablets and phones. 
- Upon implementing the Spotify API we realized that only 30 second clips were available. For future development we would like to improve upon this API functionality so that the user is able to access complete songs.
- We would also like to implement the YouTube API in the future so that when users visit the video page they can search videos through the API rather than just seeing video thumbnails.
- In the making of this project group members learned a number of things. We gained a better understanding of repository maintenance, for example, working off of different branches, merging conflicts and resolving them. It also gave the members exposure to work environments where these processes are expected. 
- Group members also improved their coding skills while learning from each other.
